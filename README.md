# 🐾 Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.  
The model extracts features from images (using resizing and HOG feature extraction), scales them, and trains an SVM classifier.  
Finally, predictions can be generated in the required Kaggle `submission.csv` format.
